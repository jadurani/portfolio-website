    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p class="py-4 text-justify">
      At the onset of the pandemic lock-downs on March 2020, hundreds of
      vehicles get stuck in line at military checkpoints in Metro Manila.
      Vehicles were being examined if its passengers were indeed Authorized
      Persons outside of Residence (APOR). These long queues and the manual
      checks increased the risk of COVID transmissions, added to the delays in
      the delivery of essential needs such as food and medicine, or in cases of
      doctors, delays in attending to their patients' medical needs.
    </p>
    <p class="py-4 text-justify">
      To speed up the process, volunteers at DEVCON (Developers Connect) came up
      with the idea that what if, before going out of their houses, the APOR
      were already registered and approved as APOR? Instead of having to
      manually present their ID or other proof as APOR, they could just present
      a QR Code which the military personnel at checkpoints could scan to verify
      the identity and status of the vehicle driver/passenger.
    </p>
    <p class="py-4 text-justify">
      And so RapidPass was created. RapidPass System is a checkpoint solution
      that provides quick passage for frontliners and other Authorized Persons
      Outside of Residence (APOR) during the implementation of the Community
      Quarantine against the COVID-19 threat.The system uses QR codes to quickly
      identify and allow entry to an APOR passing through a Quarantine Control
      Point (QCP).
    </p>
    <p class="py-4 text-justify">
      A person could register in the RapidPass Registration UI and it will be
      checked by the IATF personnel. Once approved, a QR code will be sent to
      the registrant which they could print out and present to the military
      personnel at checkpoints.
    </p>
    <p class="py-4 text-justify">
      Two hundred smartphones were donated by Smart Communications to scan the
      QR Codes.

      In this project, I was the volunteer co-lead in the development of the
      front-end app for the individual and vehicle registration of APORs.

      We used Angular and Angular Material in building this application.
