    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p class="py-4 text-justify">
      Millions of Filipinos lost their income due to the pandemic lock downs.
      The Philippine government issued an order to provide cash assistance to
      the indigent and families must register themselves as in-need of cash
      assistance by manually writing out a form given by DSWD. Once registered,
      benificiaries had to manually come in person to the designated
      disbursement areas and claim the aide in cash, which is not the best form
      of currency during the pandemic.
    </p>

    <p class="py-4 text-justify">
      To aide with the distribution of emergency funds, DEVCON, in partnership
      with USAID and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD),
      created ReliefAgad. This app streamlines the capture of SAC data and the
      dispersal of relief funds by using an e-wallet or bank account that
      enables DSWD to send aid directly to beneficiaries, using the e-payment
      systems of the regional banking industry.
    </p>
    <p class="py-4 text-justify">
      ReliefAgad is a quick relief system that enables DSWD and local government
      units (LGUs) to expedite the capture of social amelioration card (SAC)
      details and interface with any electronic payment system for faster cash
      relief to targeted beneficiaries.

    <p class="py-4 text-justify">
      As of July 2020, over 4.3 million benificiaries have registered through
      ReliefAgad, of which, over 1 million have entrolled transaction grants
      directly to their e-wallets or bank accounts
