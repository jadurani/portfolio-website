    Hey there! My name is Jadurani and I currently focus on building user
    interfaces that are delightful to use. Here is my most recent tech stack:
    <ul>
      <li>Angular</li>
      <li>Ionic</li>
      <li>Typescript</li>
      <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
      <li>GraphQL (with Hasura)</li>
    </ul>

    When I'm not coding or designing, I'm learning how to sing and play the
    piano, how to get better at yoga, or how to survive in the wild as a
    vegetarian.
